# Uniswap V3 Strategy Analysis: Look-Forward Bias and Fee Issues

## Executive Summary

The [`uniswapv3_strategy_fixed.py`](uniswapv3_strategy_fixed.py) file contains significant **look-forward bias** issues and **incomplete fee modeling** that would lead to unrealistic backtesting results. These issues would cause the strategies to appear more profitable than they would be in live trading.

## Look-Forward Bias Issues

### 1. Data Preprocessing Bias (Lines 50-65)

**Issue**: All technical indicators are calculated using the entire dataset at once, then NaN values are dropped.

```python
# PROBLEMATIC: Uses future data
self.data['volatility'] = self.data['returns'].rolling(window=20).std() * np.sqrt(365)
self.data['sma_20'] = self.data['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
self.data['sma_50'] = self.data['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
self.data['rsi'] = self._calculate_rsi(self.data['close'], 14)
self.data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Removes early periods with NaN
```

**Problem**: At any point `i`, the rolling calculations have access to future data points that wouldn't be available in real-time trading.

**Fix Required**: Calculate indicators incrementally, ensuring only past data is used at each time step.

### 2. Strategy 1: Stochastic Optimization (Lines 140-175)

**Issue**: Uses pre-calculated volatility that incorporates future data.

```python
volatility = data.iloc[i]['volatility']  # This volatility uses future data!
vol_factor = max(0.1, min(0.5, volatility))
range_multiplier = 1 + vol_factor
```

**Impact**: The strategy can "predict" optimal ranges using future price movements.

### 3. Strategy 2: Dynamic Range Management (Lines 205-230)

**Issue**: Uses pre-calculated RSI and volatility.

```python
rsi = data.iloc[i]['rsi']  # RSI calculated using future data
volatility = data.iloc[i]['volatility']  # Volatility using future data

# Range calculation based on future-biased RSI
if rsi < 30:  # Oversold - but RSI is biased!
    lower_mult = 1.3
    upper_mult = 1.1
```

**Impact**: Strategy appears to time oversold/overbought conditions perfectly using future information.

### 4. Strategy 3: Mean Reversion (Lines 269-305)

**Issue**: Z-score calculation uses future data through rolling standard deviation.

```python
data['price_zscore'] = (data['close'] - data['sma_50']) / data['close'].rolling(50).std()
```

**Problem**: The rolling standard deviation at time `i` includes future price data, making the z-score artificially accurate.

### 5. Strategy 4: Momentum Based (Lines 333-380)

**Issue**: Uses pre-calculated SMAs that include future data.

```python
sma_20 = data.iloc[i]['sma_20']  # SMA calculated using future data
sma_50 = data.iloc[i]['sma_50']  # SMA calculated using future data

if sma_20 > sma_50 * 1.02:  # Trend detection using biased data
```

**Impact**: Momentum signals are unrealistically accurate due to future data incorporation.

## Fee Handling Issues

### 1. Incomplete Cost Structure

**Current Implementation**: Only gas costs for rebalancing are considered.

```python
# Only considers gas cost for rebalancing
if i > 0:
    current_capital = max(current_capital - self.gas_cost, current_capital * 0.01)
```

**Missing Costs**:
- Pool exit fees when withdrawing liquidity
- Swap fees when rebalancing token ratios
- Price impact/slippage during large rebalances
- Re-entry fees when providing liquidity again

### 2. Unrealistic Gas Cost Modeling

**Issue**: Fixed $30 gas cost is oversimplified.

```python
self.gas_cost = 30  # USD per transaction (approximate)
```

**Reality**: 
- Gas costs vary from $5-500+ depending on network congestion
- Complex Uniswap operations (remove liquidity + swap + add liquidity) can cost $100-1000+
- Multiple transactions required for rebalancing increases total costs

### 3. Missing Breakout Costs

**Issue**: When price moves out of range, no additional costs are considered for rebalancing.

**Missing Elements**:
- Cost to swap accumulated single-asset back to 50/50 ratio
- Slippage when swapping large amounts
- Opportunity cost of being out of range

### 4. Incomplete Pool Mechanics

**Missing Considerations**:
- **Impermanent Loss**: Calculation is oversimplified
- **Concentrated Liquidity Effects**: Price impact increases with concentration
- **Pool Utilization**: Fees depend on actual trading volume through the price range

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Fix Look-Forward Bias

```python
def calculate_indicators_realtime(self, data, current_index):
    """Calculate indicators using only data up to current_index"""
    if current_index < 50:
        return None, None, None, None
    
    historical_data = data.iloc[:current_index+1]
    
    # Calculate indicators using only past data
    volatility = historical_data['returns'].tail(20).std() * np.sqrt(365)
    sma_20 = historical_data['close'].tail(20).mean()
    sma_50 = historical_data['close'].tail(50).mean()
    rsi = self._calculate_rsi(historical_data['close'], 14).iloc[-1]
    
    return volatility, sma_20, sma_50, rsi
```

### 2. Implement Comprehensive Fee Model

```python
def calculate_rebalancing_costs(self, position_value, current_price, target_range):
    """Calculate realistic rebalancing costs"""
    
    # Gas costs (variable based on network conditions)
    base_gas_cost = 50  # Base cost in USD
    gas_multiplier = np.random.uniform(0.5, 5.0)  # Simulate network congestion
    total_gas = base_gas_cost * gas_multiplier
    
    # Pool exit fees (withdraw liquidity)
    exit_fee_rate = 0.0005  # 0.05% of position value
    exit_fees = position_value * exit_fee_rate
    
    # Swap fees for rebalancing (if needed)
    swap_fee_rate = 0.0005  # 0.05% for ETH/USDC pool
    estimated_swap_amount = position_value * 0.3  # Assume 30% needs rebalancing
    swap_fees = estimated_swap_amount * swap_fee_rate
    
    # Slippage (price impact)
    slippage_rate = min(0.01, position_value / 10000000)  # 1% max, scales with size
    slippage_cost = estimated_swap_amount * slippage_rate
    
    # Re-entry costs
    reentry_fees = position_value * exit_fee_rate
    
    total_cost = total_gas + exit_fees + swap_fees + slippage_cost + reentry_fees
    return total_cost
```

### 3. Add Breakout Handling

```python
def handle_breakout(self, current_price, position_range, position_value):
    """Handle costs when price breaks out of range"""
    
    if current_price < position_range['lower'] or current_price > position_range['upper']:
        # Additional costs for emergency rebalancing
        emergency_cost_multiplier = 1.5  # Higher costs for urgent rebalancing
        breakout_costs = self.calculate_rebalancing_costs(position_value, current_price, None)
        return breakout_costs * emergency_cost_multiplier
    
    return 0
```

## Impact Assessment

### Current Issues Impact:
- **Overstated Returns**: Look-forward bias could inflate returns by 20-50%
- **Understated Costs**: Missing fees could underestimate costs by 50-200%
- **False Optimization**: Strategies appear optimal due to unrealistic information access

### Recommended Priority:
1. **High Priority**: Fix look-forward bias in indicator calculations
2. **High Priority**: Implement comprehensive fee model
3. **Medium Priority**: Add realistic gas cost variation
4. **Medium Priority**: Improve impermanent loss calculations

## Conclusion

The current implementation would significantly overestimate strategy performance due to look-forward bias and incomplete cost modeling. These issues must be addressed before the backtesting results can be considered reliable for investment decisions.

Real-world implementation would likely show:
- Lower returns due to realistic information constraints
- Higher costs due to comprehensive fee structure
- Reduced frequency of profitable rebalancing opportunities
- Greater sensitivity to market conditions and network congestion

## Testing Period Market Analysis

The backtesting was conducted on a **challenging market period** from August 2023 to April 2025:

### ⚠️ Critical Data Issue:
- **Data Gap**: January 1, 2023 - March 11, 2023 (NO TRADING DATA)
- **Actual testing starts**: March 12, 2023 (not August 2023 as originally calculated)
- **Impact**: Missing 70 days of early 2023 data affects train/test split reliability

### Market Conditions:
- **Duration**: 636 days (with data gap noted above)
- **Price Range**: $1,472.25 - $4,065.61 (ETH/USDC)
- **Overall Return**: -1.86% (declining market)
- **Volatility**: 60% annualized (high volatility environment)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -63.79%

### Market Regime Distribution:
- **Bear Market**: 43.6% of testing period (277 days)
- **Bull Market**: 35.1% of testing period (223 days)
- **Sideways Market**: 21.4% of testing period (136 days)

### Large Daily Moves (>10%):
The testing period included **14 extreme daily moves** exceeding 10%, indicating high market stress and volatility that would significantly impact Uniswap V3 strategies.

**Key Extreme Events:**
- 2024-05-20: +19.28% (largest single-day gain)
- 2025-03-03: -14.73% (major crash)
- 2025-04-06: -12.51% (continued volatility)

### Implications for Strategy Performance:
1. **High Rebalancing Frequency**: Extreme volatility would trigger frequent rebalancing
2. **Increased Gas Costs**: Network congestion during volatile periods increases transaction costs
3. **Impermanent Loss**: Large price swings significantly impact concentrated liquidity positions
4. **Range Breakouts**: Frequent price movements outside optimal ranges
